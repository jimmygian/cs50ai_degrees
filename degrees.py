    # Complete the implementation of the shortest_path function such that 
    # it returns the shortest path from the person with id source to the person with the id target.

    # Assuming there is a path from the source to the target, your function should return a list, 
    # where each list item is the next (movie_id, person_id) pair in the path from the source to the target. 
    # Each pair should be a tuple of two strings.
        # For example, if the return value of shortest_path were [(1, 2), (3, 4)], 
        # that would mean that the source starred in movie 1 with person 2, person 2 
        # starred in movie 3 with person 4, and person 4 is the target.

    # If there are multiple paths of minimum length from the source to the target, your function can return any of them.

    # If there is no possible path between two actors, your function should return None.
